## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **E2E Testing:** Chrome extensions + Playwright + headless mode = incompatible. Manual testing is more practical for extensions.

2. **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests first helped catch bugs early and ensure feature completeness.

3. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation takes time but is invaluable for users, contributors, and future maintenance.

4. **Error Handling:** A centralized error handling system (errorHandling.js) makes debugging and maintenance much easier.

5. **Incremental Development:** Breaking the project into 18 phases made it manageable and allowed for regular progress validation.
