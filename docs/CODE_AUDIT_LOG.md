# Code Audit Log

_Date: 2025-10-20_

This log tracks progress as I perform a full code review of the HTML to Figma Chrome Extension project. Each entry captures the task, actions taken, findings, and next steps.

| Step | Status | Focus | Notes | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | ✅ | Audit scope & plan | Confirmed directories to review (src, tests, figma-plugin, manifest, utils). Established review order and criteria (logic correctness, error handling, data flow). | Begin detailed review with manifest + project config. |
| 2 | ✅ | Manifest & high-level config | Verified manifest v3 settings: background service worker module, all_urls content script, permissions (scripting, activeTab, storage, clipboardWrite) align with features. Icons referenced, host permissions limited to Figma API. No issues found. | Review background service worker implementation. |
| 3 | ✅ | Background service worker (`background.js`) | Messaging flow validated: handles extraction success/errors, persists last extraction to storage, notifies popup. Element counting helper correct. `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` promise catch prevents errors when popup closed. No bugs detected. | Inspect popup UI scripts for complementary behavior. |
| 4 | ✅ | Popup UI (`popup.js` + `popup.html`) | Confirmed UI wiring: extraction flow queries active tab, handles errors via `chrome.runtime.lastError`, auto copies results, updates stats. Clipboard fallback present. HTML elements match selectors, loading states/spinners correct. No logic issues spotted. | Move to content script (core extraction). |
| 5 | ✅ | Content script (`content.js`) | Reviewed extraction pipeline: selector validation, recursive traversal with style capture, image/SVG/font extraction, Figma mapping helpers, error handling with fallbacks for browser context. No runtime bugs spotted; heuristics (e.g., parseGradient, mapLayoutMode) noted for future refinement but acceptable. | Audit shared utilities (`src/utils`). |
| 6 | ✅ | Utilities (`utils/errorHandling.js`, `helpers.js`, `tokenStorage.js`) | Error handling module provides robust validation/logging; no issues. Helpers exports simple format/log functions for tests. Token storage functions wrap `chrome.storage` with history trimming—error paths handled. No bugs identified. | Review parser modules for DOM/CSS logic. |
| 7 | ⚠️ | Parsers (`cssMapper.js`, `domExtractor.js`, `htmlParser.js`) | `cssMapper.js` mirrors mapping logic already embedded in content script—functional but redundant. `domExtractor.js` provides Node-friendly extraction (used in tests). `htmlParser.js` still placeholder; no safety impact but functionality incomplete. Recommend documenting redundancy and future consolidation. No blocking bugs. | Proceed to Figma plugin TypeScript code. |
| 8 | ✅ | Figma plugin (`figma-plugin/code.ts`, `ui.html`) | Plugin UI parses clipboard JSON, sends to plugin runtime. `code.ts` builds frame, recursively creates nodes, applies styles. Fonts fallback handled with try/catch, progress messages posted. Simplifications noted (image placeholders, basic SVG/vector handling) but no errors found. | Inspect configuration + supporting scripts (`src/config`, etc.). |
| 9 | ✅ | Configuration (`src/config/figmaConfig.js`) | Checked extension configuration constants (transfer mode, extraction/conversion defaults) and shared storage keys. Values align with runtime behavior; no inconsistencies found. | Review test suites for coverage accuracy. |
| 10 | ⚠️ | Test suite verification (`npm test`) | Re-ran Jest suite: 15/16 suites pass, 199/199 tests succeed. Known Playwright E2E suite still fails (`TransformStream` undefined in Node context). Failure matches documented limitation; no regression. Recommend keeping e2e disabled or migrating to browser-runner. | Perform spot review of key test files for coverage completeness. |
| 11 | ✅ | Test files spot-check (`tests/content*.spec.js`, etc.) | Reviewed core test suites ensuring expectations align with implementation (e.g., color parsing, gradients, unit conversion). Tests intentionally eval `content.js` for browser APIs; assertions consistent with helper behavior. No issues detected; note coverage simplicity in `content.spec.js` but acceptable given extended suite. | Final audit pass: verify no stray TODOs or console errors beyond expected logs. |
